To run the code, we followed the directions that were given to use the rai system.
	./rai -d <project folder>
Since there is a separate build file for the submission process, it doesn't make much sense 
to include ours but here is the final one. Must be placed in the project directory

rai:
  version: 0.1
resources:
  gpus: 1
commands:
  build:
    - echo "Submitting project"
    - cp -r /src /build/submission_code
    - cmake -DCONFIG_USE_HUNTER=OFF /src
    - make
    - /usr/bin/time ./ece408 /src/data/testfull.hdf5 /src/data/model.hdf5 10000

Profiling can be performed using nvprof. Place the following build commands in your rai-build.yml file

    - >-
      nvprof --cpu-profiling on --export-profile timeline.nvprof --
      ./ece408 /src/data/test10.hdf5 /src/data/model.hdf5 10
    - >-
      nvprof --cpu-profiling on --export-profile analysis.nvprof --analysis-metrics --
      ./ece408 /src/data/test10.hdf5 /src/data/model.hdf5 10
You could change the input and test datasets. This will output two files timeline.nvprof and analysis.nvprof which can be viewed using the nvvp tool (by performing a file>import).
